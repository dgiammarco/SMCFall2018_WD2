		<h2>School boy takes MICROWAVE to school to carry books after school bans bags</h2>
		
		<p>A schoolboy resorted to using a microwave to carry his books in to school as his school banned sixth formers from carrying large bags to lessons. Seventeen-year-old Jacob Ford took the stand due to the 'ridiculous' rule change at Spalding Grammar School, which was put in place to prevent younger pupils from being injured. However, the school then suspended Jacob for two days as he held a 'silent protest' where he brought his things to school in various items, including a wicker basket and a microwave.</p>
		
		<p>Jacob said: "The reasons for them changing is for one reason and one reason only which has been hammered into all of our brains over the course of the several assemblies that we've had. “Health and safety. Or more specifically, the year sevens and one member of staff. “These people have been struck in the face or knocked backwards by our bags swinging around in the corridor. “Once again, I do not doubt this ever happening. But is the best solution really to outright ban backpacks? “Surely a compromise can be made.”</p>
		
		<p>Jacob also put forward his thoughts in a 3,000 word document titled 'Bags in Sixth Form - my thoughts and a potential solution' that he gave to his head teacher Steven Wilkinson. According to Jacob, the rule stating that bags are not permitted to be carried into and used during lessons has been in place for over 25 years, but has never been enforced. Jacob claims the new bag policy forces students to risk their health and shell out cash. He said: “With most issues money is going to be involved - this case being no exception to that rule.</p>
