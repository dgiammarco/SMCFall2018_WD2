                 My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

                <p>I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words. Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?!</p>
